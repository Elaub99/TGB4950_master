These are the files relevant for the Verdalkalk pile for the master's thesis "A Comparative Study of Python-Based and ShapeMetriX Methods for Rock Fragmentation Analysis".
All scripts are uploaded as .py-files, while the fragmenter-reports are the .pdf-files.
The PSDs for the pile can be found in the _PSD excel file. The _compare-files were used to find the different P(x)-values for the P-P plot and RMSE values. The _Recalculation file is the adjustment of the scan to DSLR and the drone to DSLR.
