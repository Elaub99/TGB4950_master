These are the files relevant for the Ballangen piles for the master's thesis "A Comparative Study of Python-Based and ShapeMetriX Methods for Rock Fragmentation Analysis".
All scripts are uploaded as .py-files, while the fragmenter-reports are the .pdf-files.
The PSDs for each pile can be found in their _PSD excel files. The _compare-files were used to find the different P(x)-values for the P-P plot and RMSE values. The _Recalculation file is the adjustment of the scans to DSLR.
